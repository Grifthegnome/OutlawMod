Hi! Welcome to the Natural Trail Mod Readme and thanks for downloading.

As of 1.0.2 Natural Trail Mod has a config file now! 
For the uninitiated, the config file will appear in your VintageStoryData/ModConfig AFTER you run your game and load a map with the mod loaded for the first time.

If you can't find it there, look in VintageStory/ModConfig.

Every time you install a new version of the mod, make sure you look at your config, as options may have changed/moved around, 
I can't promise your settings will be unaltered by the update, so just give it a quick look over so we can both sleep at night.
If you are experiencing any kind of weird behavior, always check your config first, as a rule of thumb.

So what's in the config?

//ENABLE/DISABLE
dirtRoadsOnly: true/false //Enables/Disables stone and cobble road visuals.
